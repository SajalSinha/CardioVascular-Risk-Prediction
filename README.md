# Problem Statement:
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

## 1.Introduction:
A lot of people suffer from various diseases. Some diseases like Sugar, High BP,
Diabetes etc have become very common in our society. On an average around 30%
youth in each state has its BMI greater than 25, which is considered as obsess. This
small things which sometimes aren’t considered much as threat lay foundation to major
heart diseases in future. So, our model is aim to classify people goal is to predict
whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease which is based
on various behavioural trait, medical history etc.

## 2. Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning (Outlier detection, Checking Null Values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Processing ( Scaling and Feature Selection)
4. Data Splitting
5. Model Training - Used various Models
6. Evaluation Metrics

## 3. Evaluation Metrics:
**k fold Cross Val Score**
**logistic=85.01%**

**KNN =84.07%**

**Gaussian Naive Bayes=83.22%**

**SVC=84.93%**

**Decision Tree Classifier=83.86%**

**Random Forest Classifier=83.27%**

## 4. Conclusion:
• Logistic Regression got better result than any model.

• Highest Number of cigratte smoked in a day is 50.

• Males consume more cigrattes than females in a day.

• People with less education are more prone to have heart disease after 10
years.

• People with less education are more prone to get addicted to smoking.

• More males are suffering from diabetes than female.

• Those who have high BP are more prone to heart disease.

• Those who have low BP are less prone to heart disease.

• Non- diabetic people smokes more

**Some measures that can be taken to prevent Heart disease includes:**
1. No smoking
2. Maintain Healthy daily life.
3. BMI should be checked regularly inorder to have a note of ourselves.
4. As we get older, selection of food must be done properly, so that one can
control cholesterol, glucose etc.
5. Having proper cardio routine should be must. Yoga, walking or jogging are
good enough.
